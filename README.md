# Ideas

- Mobile first approach followed.
- Therapist should not focus on more than 10 students at a time for better focus.
- Help the therapist to make all the moves from a single place within the mobile whereever he/she is.
- Protect the user from making a mistake by forcing him/her to delete one by one.
- Data with no more than a thousand records can be cached in the borwser; therefore not need to make API filter; this way we improve performance
- In memory api for better API mocking while developing.

# Missing
- Functionality for Edit Student due to lack of time
- Move students service to a shred folder
- Unit Tests at least for the service layer (Priority).
- Rename add-student.component to manage-student.component since the idea is for this component to handle save and update operations
- My profile section.
